    "### 1.1 What is hash tabe?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Associative array\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash table is a data structure used to implement an associative array that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets, from which the desired value can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but it is possible that two keys will generate an identical hash causing both keys to point to the same bucket. Instead, most hash table designs assume that hash collisions—different keys that are assigned by the hash function to the same bucket—will occur and must be accommodated in some way. (Chaining, open addressing)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Hash_table_5_0_1_1_1_1_0_SP.svg/380px-Hash_table_5_0_1_1_1_1_0_SP.svg.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Average cost / complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "In a well-dimensioned hash table, the average cost for each lookup is independent of the number of elements stored in the table. Many hash table designs also allow arbitrary insertions and deletions of key-value pairs, at constant average cost per operation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A virtual function (virtual method) is a function whose behavior can be overridden within an inheriting class by a function with the same signature. \n",

    "- This concept is an important part of the polymorphism portion of object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Why do we need it\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, when a derived class inherits from a base class, an object of the derived class may be referred to via a pointer or reference of the base class type instead of the derived class type. If there are base class methods overridden by the derived class, the method actually called by such a reference or pointer can be bound either 'early' (by the compiler), according to the declared type of the pointer or reference, or 'late' (i.e., by the runtime system of the language), according to the actual type of the object referred to.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Abstract Class (ABC) / Pure Virtual\n",
    "\n",
    "A pure virtual function or pure virtual method is a virtual function that is required to be implemented by a derived class if the derived class is not abstract. Classes containing pure virtual methods are termed \"abstract\" and $\\textbf{they cannot be instantiated directly}$. A subclass of an abstract class can only be instantiated directly if $\\textbf{all inherited pure virtual methods have been implemented}$ by that class or a parent class. Pure virtual methods typically have a declaration (signature) and no definition (implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although pure virtual methods typically have no implementation in the class that declares them, pure virtual methods in C++ are permitted to contain an implementation in their declaring class, providing default behaviour that a derived class can delegate to, if appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Virtual Destructor\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object-oriented languages typically manage memory allocation and de-allocation automatically when objects are created and destroyed. However, some object-oriented languages allow a custom destructor method to be implemented, if desired. (Python, Java)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the language in question uses automatic memory management, the custom destructor (generally called a finalizer in this context) that is called is certain to be the appropriate one for the object in question. For example, if an object of type Wolf that inherits Animal is created, and both have custom destructors, the one called will be the one declared in Wolf."

    "\n",
    "In computer science, a memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in such a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released. \n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, a memory leak may happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code. A memory leak has symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program's source code.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Consequences\n",
    "\n",
    "- A memory leak can diminish the performance of the computer by reducing the amount of available memory. All or part of the system or device stops working correctly, the application fails, or the system slows down vastly due to thrashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory leaks may not be serious or even detectable by normal means. In modern operating systems, normal memory used by an application is released when the application terminates. This means that a memory leak in a program that only runs for a short time may not be noticed and is rarely serious.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "while (button_pressed == true):\n",
    "    floor_number* ptr = new floor_number; // which will be used to remember the floor number\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if (curr_floor == target_floor) // Are we already on the target floor?\n",
    "        return; // if so, nothing to do\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "        while (lift_isIdle == false) {} // wait until the lift is idle\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence is called an increasing sequence if each character in the sequence is strictly greater than the one before it (if there is one). For example, \"abcdgz\" is an increasing sequence and \"abccd\" and \"abcda\" are not increasing sequences. The comparison of the character is by the ASCII values. Similarly a sequence is called a decreasing sequence if each character in the sequence is strictly smaller than the one before it (if there is one). Now, a sequence is called a \"V\" sequence is if it is composed of a decreasing sequence followed by an increasing sequence with one character of overlap. For example, \"zyxabcd\" is a \"V\" sequence because it is made up of a decreasing sequence \"zyxa\" followed by an increasing sequence \"abcd\" where the two sequences overlap at the character \"a\". \n",
