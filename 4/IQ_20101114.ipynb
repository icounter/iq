    "### 3.2 Longest Sequence V\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence is called an increasing sequence if each character in the sequence is strictly greater than the one before it (if there is one). For example, \"abcdgz\" is an increasing sequence and \"abccd\" and \"abcda\" are not increasing sequences. The comparison of the character is by the ASCII values. Similarly a sequence is called a decreasing sequence if each character in the sequence is strictly smaller than the one before it (if there is one). Now, a sequence is called a \"V\" sequence is if it is composed of a decreasing sequence followed by an increasing sequence with one character of overlap. For example, \"zyxabcd\" is a \"V\" sequence because it is made up of a decreasing sequence \"zyxa\" followed by an increasing sequence \"abcd\" where the two sequences overlap at the character \"a\". \n",
